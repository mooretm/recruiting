## v0.0.0

Date: 17 Jun, 2022

### Bugs
1. The ProFit logic for determining acoustic coupling type is incorrect as implemented in the code. This logic also relies on the recommended receiver matrix, but this logic was not available at the time. The matrix recommendation logic has been requested (today) and should be implemented as soon as possible.
